Current version: pre-1.1

Changes between 1.0.6 and 1.1:
 - Renamed project from 'AsoBrain Lightweight 3D Toolkit' to 'AsoBrain 3D Toolkit' (no longer 'lightweight', because it also supports heavyweight Java 3D now).
 - Added Java 3D support (ab.j3d.java3d).
 - Added 3D Studio file (.3ds) support (ab.j3d.a3ds).
 - Added opacity properties for faces.
 - Added 'reversePoints' argument to Polyline2D.transform() method to reverse the point ordering of the returned path.
 - Added 'reversePath' argument to Object3DBuilder.addFace() method to reverse the point ordering of the path.
 - Project uses standarized directory layout ('classes' for temporary .class files, and 'lib' for .jar files).
 - Replaced Java 1.1 containers with Java2 collection classes.
 - Split Renderer class into RenderPanel and Renderer:
   > RenderPanel extends JPanel and contains user interface code (mouse control), temporary wireframe painting, and thread control based on the panel's visibility (stop/start thread when the component is hidden/shown).
   > Renderer contains the background rendering code. Fixed various concurrency issues from old Renderer class.
 - Bug-fix: Materials without texture caused NullPointerException in Object3DBuilder.Face.build().

Changes between 1.0.5 and 1.0.6:
 - Added TextureLibrary interface that can be used to retrieve textures from some sort of library.

Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.0.5:
 - Added Polyline2D class (and its friends PolyPoint2D and Bounds2D) to describe 2D shapes (Numdata Open Source Software license).
 - Added Object3DBuilder class to simplify creation of Object3D instances (Numdata Open Source Software license).
 - Moved source files from 'src' directory to project root.

Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:
 - Added TextureSpec.opacity property to support non-opaque objects (fully opaque = 1.0, completely translucent = 0.0).

Changes since 1.0.2:
 - Added Vector3D.normalize() method returning a normalized vector. 
 - Added TextureSpec.getHtmlRGB() to get its RGB value as HTML text in '#rrggbb' format.

Changes since 1.0.1:
 - Added Object3D.getFaceTextureU/V() methods to allow public access to texture coordinates.

Changes since 1.0.0:
 - Changed Renderer.renderWireframeFace() from static to instance method.
